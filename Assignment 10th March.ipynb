    "The p-value in hypothesis testing is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated from the sample data, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In simpler terms, the p-value quantifies the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "Here's an explanation of its significance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Interpretation:\n",
    "If the p-value is small (typically less than the chosen significance level α), it suggests that the observed data are unlikely to occur if the null hypothesis is true. This leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
